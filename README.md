## Problem Statement

Software services companies often have a large pool of software engineers. To attract clients, they frequently send cold emails based on job requirements found on career pages. The challenge lies in formulating relevant and appealing emails that highlight the skills and expertise of their engineers, particularly for contract-based hiring.

2. **Utilize Llama 3.1**: The extracted data is analyzed using Llama 3.1, which identifies key elements such as roles, required skills, and job descriptions. This information is then structured into a JSON format.

3. **Store in Chroma DB**: The JSON data is stored in Chroma DB, which facilitates quick access to related portfolio links based on the extracted skills and roles.

4. **Generate Email**: Using the portfolio links and the information from the JSON file, the system generates a tailored cold email that addresses the clientâ€™s requirements.
